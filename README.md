After my kids forgot to turn off cellular data when playing Pokemon GO, I accidentally blew through $50 of data â€“not realizing my iPhone was ignoring my home wi-fi connection. 

Again. Grr. 


This app will notify you when cellular data is left on. You can shush it for up to 1-3 hours.

Someone please make me an icon.
